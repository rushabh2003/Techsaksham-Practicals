Working with Files:

command                                                                                                         function
touch filename1 fileName2 fileName3 ….                                          (easy way to create a file)
cp file1 file2 or cp fileName filePath                                                     (copy content of a file to other file)
mv fileName1 fileName2or mv fileName1 filePath/dirPath          (move file content or file to other dir)
cp -r dirName1 dirName2                                                                          (recursive copy)
cp file1 file2 file3 file4 file5 /dirName                                                  (cp multiple files to directory)
head                                                                                                                  (display first 10 lines)
tail                                                                                                                     (display last 10 lines)
cat                                                                                                                     (display content)
cat > fileName                                                                                               (create file with concatenated content (ctrl+d for EOL))

File Access Rights:

(Use ls -l to check file access rights)

3 Types of Access Rights:
• Read access (r)
• Write access (w)
• Execute rights (x)

3 Types of Access Levels:
• User (u): for the owner of the file
• Group (g): each file also has a “group” attribute, corresponding to a given list of users
• Others (o): for all other users
